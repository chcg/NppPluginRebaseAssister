# RebaseAssister plugin for Notepad++

It currently features

  * Auto-selection of git commands, making it super fast to change those `Pick` into whatever you need during interactive rebasing.
  * Syntax highlighting

Notepad++ itself offers additional benefits 

  * Short cuts for moving lines up/down
  * Spell check (using the great `DSpellCheck` plugin)
  * With verbose backup you'll always have a backup of the guids if you need to save deleted commits using reflog.
  
  
# Installation
This plugin is too new to have been added to the notepad++ pluginmanager - that takes a couple of months to get in place. So manual installation only.

  * Download a binary release and stick the `RebaseAssister.dll` inside the `c:\program files (x86)\notepad++\plugins\` folder.

Alternatively, download the source and build it - the build will copy the dll to the notepad folder.



# Misc
This plugin has been created using the `Notepad++ pluginpack for .Net` https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net/releases
